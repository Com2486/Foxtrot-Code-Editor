# Foxtrot Code Editor
Open-source, fully in-game file editor made in Skript.

Credits go to Com2486 for pretty much everything, and eggyfries for being the useless assistant who gave him ideas, and is also writing the readme right now ~~(help i am trapped in his basement)~~ THERE IS NO ONE IN COM'S BASEMENT WE PROMISE



The Foxtrot Updater will be merged into Foxtrot soon.



# Usage
You can use Foxtrot un-edited without credit as long as you do not claim it as yours

If you use modified Foxtrot or make changes to Foxtrot, you can do that as long as you credit me
Ideally, link to this Github page, or my Discord username (com2486)
